        <p class="aboutPara">If you want to help the environment, one of the simplest ways starts from the bags you use.

The single use plastic bags you can get at some grocery stores take a long time to decompose and can harm animals. By using reusable bags, you can reduce the amount of plastic waste. A reusable shopping bag to consider is a jute or hessian bag. Jute bags are made from vegetable fibers that are not only durable, but also biodegradable, which means they can be naturally broken down by microorganisms. Cotton bags like canvas or calico bags are also a good alternative as they are biodegradable and long-lasting. Paper bags are lacking in terms of durability, but can decompose naturally and be recycled.

If reusable bags are unavailable, you can still find ways to reuse plastic bags. You can use them to store items or carry your things the next time you go out.
